### 문제 설명

<p>John likes sorting algorithms very much. He has studied quicksort, merge sort, radix sort, and many more.</p>

<p>A long time ago he has written a lock-free parallel string sorting program. It was a combination of burstsort and multi-key quicksort. To implement burstsort you need to build a tree of buckets. For each input string you walk through the tree and insert part of the string into the right bucket. When a bucket fills up, it "bursts" and becomes a new subtree (with new buckets).</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure G.1: Burstsort data structure</p>

<p>Well, enough about the past. Today John is playing with sorting algorithms again. This time it’s numbers. He has an idea for a new algorithm, “extreme sort”. It’s extremely fast, performance levels are OVER NINETHOUSAND. Before he tells anyone any details, he wants to make sure that it works correctly.</p>

<p>Your task is to help him and verify that the so-called extreme property holds after the first phase of the algorithm. The extreme property is defined as min (x<sub>i,j</sub>) ≥ 0, where</p>

<pre>x<sub>i,j</sub> = a<sub>j</sub> - a<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ i < j ≤ N)
     = 9001    (otherwise)</pre>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1024). The second line contains N integers a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> . . . a<sub>N</sub> (1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1024).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print one line of output containing “yes” if the extreme property holds for the given input, “no” otherwise.</p>
