### 문제 설명

<p>In the 2006 Wachowski Brothers movie thriller, starring Hugo Weaving as the main character and Natalie Portman as Evey, V is an anarchist freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution against the brutal neo-fascist regime that has subjugated the dystopian United Kingdom and exterminated its opponents in concentration camps.</p>

<p>To commemorate V and his attempt to complete the failed mission of Guy Fawkes, an 17th century English soldier who attempted to assassinate King James I of England, but was prevented from doing so by his arrest on November 5, 1605, your job is to output the V symbol in large print, using stars to create it.</p>

<p>How you choose to create the output is up to you, either via brute force (fairly easy, but takes time), or some elegant and dynamic technique (more difficult, but a much better, quicker way).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Several integers N, all on one line, ranging in value 2≤N≤9.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A V symbol for each input value N, as shown in examples below, with no blank lines of separation between each V.</p>
