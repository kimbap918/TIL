### 문제 설명

<p>In the String class, there exists a function called substring. Your task is to do the opposite of the substring function. Rather than returning a specified substring within the String, you will output the String with the substring taken out.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will be one line with a string and two integers i and j, separated by spaces. The first int, i, is the start index of the substring to be taken out, and the substring removed extends to index j-1. Thus the length of the substring removed is j-i. You may assume that 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ length(string).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the given string, with the substring taken out specified by the given integers. The output will be n lines, with no leading or trailing white space.</p>
